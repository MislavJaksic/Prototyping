## Git Pages

### [Create](https://pages.github.com/)

### View

Display a Git Page of a repository in your browser with the URI format:
- username.github.io/repositoryname

As far as I can tell, only static pages can be displayed.

Ruby on Rails is a dynamic page generator as their web pages cannot be displayed. Use [Horeku](https://www.heroku.com/) instead.
